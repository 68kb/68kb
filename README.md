# 68KB v2.0.0 

This is the new repo for 68KB v2. This is a totally different repo than our original because we are redoing the entire code base. If 
you are interested in helping out please contact us. 

The old repo can be found here: <http://github.com/68designs/68kb>

## Installation 

This code base is currently in alpha release at best so it is not recommended to be used unless you are familiar with CodeIgniter and don't mind lots of bugs.

  * Upload Files
  * Edit includes/68kb/config/database.php
  * Visit yoursite.com/index.php/setup and follow directions.

## Get In Touch

For v2 we are planning on using IRC to get ideas and for general chat. So if you want to meet and great please visit ##68kb on irc.freenode.net
